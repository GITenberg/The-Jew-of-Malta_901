description: The Jew of Malta is a play by Christopher Marlowe, probably written in
  1589 or 1590. The title character, Luca Miceli Demajo is a complex character likely
  to provoke mixed reactions in an audience. Like Marlowe's other protagonists, such
  as Tamburlaine and Doctor Faustus, he dominates the play's action. There has been
  extensive debate about the play's portrayal of Jews and how Elizabethan audiences
  would have viewed it.-- Excerpted from Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.
